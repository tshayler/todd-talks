# Making Sense

A liberal arts education provides a foundation for a life of human inquiry and problem solving. 
What has that meant for me? I discuss my undergraduate experience as a math major,
my early jobs, graduate school, and how I got to a career in systems engineering research.
How has my liberal arts education prepared me for a life of making sense?
